# Zepto E-commerce SQL Data Analyst Portfolio Project
This is a complete, real-world data analyst portfolio project based on an e-commerce inventory dataset scraped from Zepto — one of India’s fastest-growing quick-commerce startups. This project simulates real analyst workflows, from raw data exploration to business-focused data analysis.

# 📌 Project Overview
The goal is to simulate how actual data analysts in the e-commerce or retail industries work behind the scenes to use SQL to:

✅ Set up a messy, real-world e-commerce inventory database

✅ Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to explore product categories, availability, and pricing inconsistencies

✅ Implement Data Cleaning to handle null values, remove invalid entries, and convert pricing from paise to rupees

✅ Write business-driven SQL queries to derive insights around pricing, inventory, stock availability, revenue and more

# 📁 Dataset Overview
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and was originally scraped from Zepto’s official product listings. It mimics what you’d typically encounter in a real-world e-commerce inventory system.

Each row represents a unique SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) for a product. Duplicate product names exist because the same product may appear multiple times in different package sizes, weights, discounts, or categories to improve visibility – exactly how real catalog data looks.

🧾 Columns:

. sku_id: Unique identifier for each product entry (Synthetic Primary Key)

. name: Product name as it appears on the app

. category: Product category like Fruits, Snacks, Beverages, etc.

. mrp: Maximum Retail Price (originally in paise, converted to ₹)

. discountPercent: Discount applied on MRP

. discountedSellingPrice: Final price after discount (also converted to ₹)

. availableQuantity: Units available in inventory

. weightInGms: Product weight in grams

. outOfStock: Boolean flag indicating stock availability

. quantity: Number of units per package (mixed with grams for loose produce)

# 🔧 Project Workflow
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what we do in this project:

1. Database & Table Creation
We start by creating a SQL table with appropriate data types:

```CREATE TABLE zepto (
  sku_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  category VARCHAR(120),
  name VARCHAR(150) NOT NULL,
  mrp NUMERIC(8,2),
  discountPercent NUMERIC(5,2),
  availableQuantity INTEGER,
  discountedSellingPrice NUMERIC(8,2),
  weightInGms INTEGER,
  outOfStock BOOLEAN,
  quantity INTEGER
);
```
